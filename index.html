                                    MIST came into existence on 19 April 1998 and academic programs were launched in January 1999. 
                                    The initial batches included only selected military students. However, feeling the necessity of spreading quality engineering education, 
                                    the authority decided to admit civil students (both male and female) and from 2002, civilian students were admitted in different departments through 
                                    passing a rigorous admission test.

                                    The maiden department of the institute was the Civil Engineering department, which started functioning in 1999. In 2000, 
                                    Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) department was established. Mechanical Engineering (ME) department and 
                                    Electrical, Electronic & Communication Engineering (EECE) department were established in the year 2003. 
                                    MIST started its Masters program in different disciplines from 2012 and MPhil/PhD from year 2014.[2]
                                    
                                    In the beginning MIST was affiliated with the University of Dhaka (DU).

Why choose Us?
Department of Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) was established as part of MIST in the academic session 2000-2001 as CSIT. From a modest beginning, offering 
undergraduate BSc program to only military students, the dept has now evolved as one of the largest depts at MIST. The dept of CSE now offers BSc programme at the 
undergraduate level, MSc and MEngg at the post graduate level, as also a doctorate in philosophy PhD. <br>
<br>

The dept of CSE boasts of highly qualified faculties, along with state of the art learning infrastructure which provides an ideal platform for students to hone in 
their skills in the field of computer sciences. The dept provides an ideal environment for the student to specialize in contemporary fields of Computer Science 
including Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, Machine Learning, Data Analytics, Network & Data Security to name a few. The dept also collaborates with both the 
industry and Govt departments and agencies thereby establishing a symbiotic leadership for both stake holders which is especially beneficial for students.
